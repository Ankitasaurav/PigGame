# About

- Pig game is a fun game that required only two players at one time. 
- This game starts from player 1 by clicking the "ROLL DICE" button, and the score will be added to your current score but, if the value of the dice is zero then, the current   score automatically be zero and that will also switch the player. 
- When you will hold the score by clicking on the "HOLD" button, then all the current scores will be added to your final score on the top, and that will also change the player.
- The game ends when a player gets 100 final points.

Note: This game is a part of my javascript course, created by @jonasschmedtmann on Udemy.
